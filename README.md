# Keepsy

Keep your data private!

Keepsy offers privacy-first scalable unified data storage engine for everyone to use across devices or cloud services with encrypted data transfer over the internet.

## Goals

- Unified interface across local and cloud storage.
- **Privacy-first**: Encryption-at-rest, end-to-end encryption (E2EE), zero-knowledge principles.
- **Scalable**: From single-user MB-scale to enterprise PB-scale.
- **Modular**: Support plug-in storage backends, sync engines, and access layers.
- **Open by design (optional)**: API-first, SDK for developers, CLI and GUI clients.

## Get Started

```shell
keepsy create.sql
```
