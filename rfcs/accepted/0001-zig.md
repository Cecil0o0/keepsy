# Why choose Zig rather than C++/Rust/Go/TypeScript?

## Summary

As annouced by zig orgnization that it is a small simple programming language with no hidden control flow, no hidden allocations, it means we could and should focus on debugging our application rather than the knowledge of programming language. Based on that our users also could choose both performance and safety for application development with the powerful comprehensive comptime optimization implemented by native compiler.
正如 zig 组织宣称的那样它是一门小巧简单的编程语言，没有隐藏控制流，没有隐藏内存分配，这意味着我们能够聚焦于调试我们的应用程序而不是编程语言知识。基于此我们用户也能够在应用程序开发中同时选择性能和安全性，通过由原生编译器实施的强大全面的编译时优化。

## Motivation

To start up with system programming, that requires us to think deeply about **hardware interaction**, **low-level control**, and **performance-critical design**. Since Keepsy needs to handle everything from tiny local files to large-scale storage, we must build it with **Zig's systems programming strengths** front and center.
起始于系统编程，那要求我们深入思考有关**硬件交互**, **底层控制** 和 **性能关键型设计**。因为 keepsy 需要处理从微小本地文件到大规模存储，我们必须以 Zig 的系统编程优势为中心构建它。

A decentralized community structure can offer significant benefits to a programming language, fostering its growth, resilience, and long-term health. So as [Zig's community](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community).
一个去中心化社区结构能够为编程语言提供显著的好处，促进其发展、韧性和长期的健康。[Zig 社区](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community)就是如此。


## Detailed Explanation

{{Describe the expected changes in detail, }}

## Rationale and Alternatives

{{Discuss 2-3 different alternative solutions that were considered. This is required, even if it seems like a stretch. Then explain why this is the best choice out of available ones.}}

## Implementation

{{Give a high-level overview of implementation requirements and concerns. Be specific about areas of code that need to change, and what their potential effects are. Discuss which repositories and sub-components will be affected, and what its overall code effect might be.}}

{{THIS SECTION IS REQUIRED FOR RATIFICATION -- you can skip it if you don't know the technical details when first submitting the proposal, but it must be there before it's accepted}}

## Prior Art

{{This section is optional if there are no actual prior examples in other tools}}

{{Discuss existing examples of this change in other tools, and how they've addressed various concerns discussed above, and what the effect of those decisions has been}}

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding

{{Write about any arbitrary decisions that need to be made (syntax, colors, formatting, minor UX decisions), and any questions for the proposal that have not been answered.}}

{{THIS SECTION SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE RATIFICATION}}
