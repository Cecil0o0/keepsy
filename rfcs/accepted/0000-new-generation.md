1. ðŸŒŽ Data is Growing Exponentially - We need a unified storage.
    - Problems:
        - By 20xx, global data will reach over xx xB
        - Data lives everywhere: local disks, cloud providers, edge services.
        - No single format or system unifies it at all. Database softwares are disorderly in open-source or closed-source.
    - Keepsy's Solution:
        - A unified interface that abstracts away where data is stored.
        - Whether it's 1KB on your laptop or 1PB across AWS/GCP/Azure , Keepsy makes it feel like one system.
        - Built with Columnar Data Format as a foundation for structured/tabular data.

âœ… Future value: The unified filesystem layer for any data scale and popular storage backend.
