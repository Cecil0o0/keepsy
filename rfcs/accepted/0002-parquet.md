# Parquet - A data file format

Let's started with the concept of file. A file is a named collection of data stored on a computer's storage device (e.g., hard drive, SSD) that represents information in a structured format.

For example, a '.txt' file collects human-readable characters without any formating, also called 'plain text', which is typically contains unstructured or minimally constructured data such as notes, novels, contracts, legal provisions. With that format, we could easily read lines or paragraphs for receiving useful information, but it could be storaged but not be suitable for retrievals(many problems if you do), thus we need a constructed format prepared to do data analysis based on retrievals or even accquire a insight, an general advanced requirements by people.
