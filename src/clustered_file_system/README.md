# About

A clustered file system (CFS) is a file system which is shared by being simutaneously mounted on multiple hosts. There are several approaches to clustering, most of which do not employ a clustered file system (only direct attached storage for each node). Clustered file systems can provide features like location-independent addressing and redundancy which improve reliability or reduce the complexity of the other parts of the cluster. Parallel file systems are a type of clustered file system that spread data across multiple storage nodes, usually for redundancy or performance.
集群式文件系统是一种同时挂载于多主机从而实现共享的文件系统。有一些方法达成集群化，其中大部分不应用集群式文件系统（仅直接在每个节点上附着存储）。集群式文件系统可以提供像位置无关寻址和冗余等特性它提高可靠性或减少集群部分的复杂性。并行文件系统是一种类型的集群式文件系统它将数据分布于多个存储节点，通常用途为冗余或性能。
